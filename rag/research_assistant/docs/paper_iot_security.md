# Zero-Trust Architecture for Large-Scale IoT Systems

## Abstract
This work presents a device identity framework using hardware fingerprints combined with periodic cryptographic re-attestation. In a 1,000-node IoT deployment, unauthorized access attempts dropped by 87%.

## Keywords
IoT Security, Zero-Trust, Device Identity, Cryptography

## Introduction
IoT fleets require identity-first security. We leverage unique hardware fingerprints and lightweight re-attestation.

## Results
Across 1,000 nodes, mean time-to-detect anomalies improved by 42% while CPU overhead stayed under 4%.

## Conclusion
Zero-trust at the edge is practical and improves resilience without significant overhead.
