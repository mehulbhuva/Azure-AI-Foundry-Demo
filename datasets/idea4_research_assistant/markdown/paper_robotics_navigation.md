# Robust Probabilistic Navigation for Autonomous Robots

## Abstract
We introduce a Bayesian motion-planning algorithm resilient to sensor noise up to 22% Gaussian variance. The method improves localization accuracy in cluttered indoor environments.

## Keywords
Robotics, Probabilistic Planning, Sensor Fusion, Localization

## Introduction
Uncertain sensing degrades path planning. Our method fuses multiple sensors in a Bayesian framework.

## Results
Real-time performance on Nvidia Jetson Xavier with reduced collision rate by 15% in cluttered environments.

## Conclusion
Probabilistic smoothing improves navigation robustness under sensor noise.
